// It receives Wix `ORDER_APPROVED` events (and optional subscription lifecycle events),
// verifies the RS256 JWT, resolves the buyer's pending Purchase by checkout id, and marks
// it paid exactly once. It pairs with `create-checkout`, which MUST persist
// `checkoutSession.id` on the Purchase — Wix has no custom-metadata field, so the checkout
// id is the ONLY correlation key back to this app's user.
